            <h2><em>About me</em></h2>
            <p>Software Engineering student at UFMS, passionate about technology and software development. Throughout my
                studies, I have developed skills in programming, systems analysis, and software design, with hands-on
                experience in languages such as Java, Python, <abbr title="HyperText">HTML</abbr> and C, as well as
                knowledge in SQL, <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr>, and agile
                methodologies. I am seeking an internship opportunity in development where I can apply my academic
                knowledge, contribute to real projects, and continue to grow professionally. Committed to continuous
                learning and delivering effective solutions, I am excited to collaborate with a dynamic and innovative
                team.
